## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
raw = read_excel("Hewins_Metadata_Sept12021.xlsx")
(genre = data.frame(raw[35:51]))
genre[1]
max(raw$Date_of_Publication, na.rm = TRUE)
num_fictions = 0
for (i in 1:ncol(genre))
  num_fictions = num_fictions + sum(apply(genre[i], 1, function(x)as.integer(any(grep("iction",x)))))
num_fictions
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
